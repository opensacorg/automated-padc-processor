# ADA Audit Tool - PADC Processor

A comprehensive, ADA-compliant GUI application for processing school attendance data and generating ADA (Average Daily Attendance) audit reports and dashboards.

## Overview

This tool automates the processing of Program Apportionment Data Collection (PADC) files for charter schools, specifically designed to handle multiple program types (C, N, J, K) with various location-specific variants (TK, CM, SYC). The application provides an accessible, keyboard-navigable interface that meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automated Data Processing**: Extracts student attendance data from Excel files based on configurable program boundaries
- **Multiple Program Support**: Handles 12+ program variations across resident/non-resident and independent study programs
- **Boundary Management**: Save and load program boundary configurations for different schools/locations
- **Dashboard Generation**: Creates CSV dashboards with ADA summaries by program, month, and grade level
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and detailed logging

### Accessibility Features
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant**: High contrast color scheme with proper text-to-background ratios
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard access with comprehensive shortcuts (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+L, Ctrl+R, etc.)
- **Screen Reader Compatible**: Proper ARIA labels and accessible widget configurations
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus indicators for all interactive elements
- **High Contrast Mode**: Automatic detection and support for Windows high contrast settings
- **Scrolling Support**: Multiple scrolling methods (keyboard, mouse, page navigation)

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (primary), macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Excel**: Input files must be in .xlsx format
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- **Display**: Minimum 1200x800 resolution for optimal GUI experience

```

## Quick Start

### Running the GUI Application
```bash
python ADA_Audit_GUI.py
```

### Basic Workflow
1. **Select Input File** (Ctrl+O): Choose your PADC Excel file
2. **Select Output File** (Ctrl+S): Choose where to save processed data
3. **Load & Analyze** (Ctrl+L): Load data and auto-detect program boundaries
4. **Review Boundaries**: Edit boundaries in the table if needed
5. **Run Audit** (Ctrl+R): Execute the audit process
6. **Run Dashboard** (Ctrl+D): Generate CSV dashboard (optional)
7. **Export Results**: Save results to Excel

## Program Structure

### Program Types

The tool supports the following program configurations:

**Program C - Charter Resident**
- `Prog_C`: Main program (includes CM and SYC locations)
- `Prog_C_TK`: Transitional Kindergarten (separate)
- `Prog_C_CM`: McClellan location (consolidated with main)
- `Prog_C_SYC`: Sacramento Youth Center (consolidated with main)

**Program N - Non-Resident Charter**
- `Prog_N`: Main program (includes CM and SYC locations)
- `Prog_N_TK`: Transitional Kindergarten (separate)
- `Prog_N_CM`: McClellan location (consolidated with main)
- `Prog_N_SYC`: Sacramento Youth Center (consolidated with main)

**Program J - Independent Study Charter Resident**
- `Prog_J`: Main program
- `Prog_J_TK`: Transitional Kindergarten

**Program K - Independent Study Charter Non-Resident**
- `Prog_K`: Main program
- `Prog_K_TK`: Transitional Kindergarten

## Configuration

### Boundary Settings

Boundary settings define where each program's data begins and ends in the Excel file. The tool can:
- Auto-detect boundaries by analyzing the input file
- Save configurations for reuse across similar files
- Load pre-configured boundary settings for specific schools

Example boundary configuration (JSON):
```json
{
  "name": "COA Elementary",
  "program_boundaries": {
    "Prog_C": {"start": 5, "stop": 28},
    "Prog_C_TK": {"start": 29, "stop": 48}
  }
}
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+O | Open input file |
| Ctrl+S | Select output file |
| Ctrl+L | Load and analyze data |
| Ctrl+R | Run audit process |
| Ctrl+E | Export results |
| Ctrl+D | Run ADA Dashboard |
| F1 | Show help |
| F2-F5 | Sort table by different columns |
| Esc | Return focus to main window |
| Ctrl+Up/Down | Scroll line by line |
| Page Up/Down | Scroll page by page |

## Output Files

### Audit Output
- Excel file with extracted attendance data
- Organized by program, month, and grade level
- Column AJ values (attendance figures)

### Dashboard Output
- CSV file with ADA summary data
- Columns: Year, School, Location, Month, Program, TK, Grade Level, ADA %, Total ADA
- Suitable for import into BI tools or further analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'tkinter'"**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# macOS (via Homebrew)
brew install python-tk
```

**"File not found" errors**
- Ensure input file path is correct
- Check that the file is not open in Excel
- Verify file permissions

**Boundary detection fails**
- Manually review the Excel file structure
- Check that program names match expected values
- Adjust boundaries manually in the GUI table

**GUI scaling issues**
- Adjust Windows display scaling (Settings > Display)
- Minimum recommended resolution: 1200x800

## Development

### Running from Source
```bash
python ADA_Audit_GUI.py
